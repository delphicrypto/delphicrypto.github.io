<h1> Episodes </h1>

* <b> Episode 3: Asynchrous Blockchain Without Consensus </b> (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/0M7b187OR1buXTVuW1hHOT?si=ssluUyr6SC6JxE-AwPSwcQ" target="_blank">Spotify</a>)

In this episode we are joined by guest and fellow PhD student, Simon Sehayek. 
We discuss a recent paper which proposes an asynchrous blockchain using a graph structure instead of a blockchain. 
This would allow the network to avoid proof of work and promises transaction finality. 
We also go over some blockchain fundamentals including double spending and network consensus.

* <b> Episode 2: Improving Proof-of-Work Difficulty Updates </b> (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/5G9G4gXlVGJXwtHMeRa9U3?si=MPeqq6ChQyStI_OyoEXrCw" target="_blank">Spotify</a>)

In this episode of The Blockchain Journal Club, we discuss a recent paper which proposes an alternate way to adjust the difficulty in blockchain mining to guarantee more reliable block times.

The author tries to improve the responsiveness of mining difficulty to rapidly changing hash-rates. Most blockchain implementations are very slow to update mining difficulty. This can cause problems where powerful miners are able to control the difficulty and can end up crashing certain currencies.

* <b> Episode 1: Using Blockchain to Solve Scientific Problems  </b> (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4QCZ5AFYe1ZPHRHbYiRuAt?si=0R5FKksXRd-attTuH6QA0A" target="_blank">Spotify</a>)

In this episode we discuss a recent paper of ours "Difficulty Scaling in Proof of Work for Decentralized Problem Solving".

We'll be going over the basics of how mining is achieved in blockchains like Bitcoin and how various efforts have been made to leverage computational power towards solving scientific problems.

These problems can go from protein folding for drug discovery to neural network parameter searching.
