[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.10926)

We discuss a recent paper which proposes an asynchrous blockchain using a graph structure instead of a blockchain. 
In this episode we are joined by Jakub Sliwinski, author of the paper we will be discussing.. 
This would allow the network to avoid proof of work and promises transaction finality. 
We also go over some blockchain fundamentals including double spending and network consensus.
