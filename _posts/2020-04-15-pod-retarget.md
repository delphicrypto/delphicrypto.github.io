In this episode of The Blockchain Journal Club, we discuss a recent paper which proposes an alternate way to adjust the difficulty in blockchain mining to guarantee more reliable block times.

The author tries to improve the responsiveness of mining difficulty to rapidly changing hash-rates. Most blockchain implementations are very slow to update mining difficulty. This can cause problems where powerful miners are able to control the difficulty and can end up crashing certain currencies.
