Paper: [Ledger Journal](http://ledger.pitt.edu/ojs/ledger/article/view/194)

In this episode we discuss a recent paper of ours "Difficulty Scaling in Proof of Work for Decentralized Problem Solving".

We'll be going over the basics of how mining is achieved in blockchains like Bitcoin and how various efforts have been made to leverage computational power towards solving scientific problems.

These problems can go from protein folding for drug discovery to neural network parameter searching.
