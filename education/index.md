* Computational Biology 
* Network Science
* Blockchain Technology
* Statistical & Mathematical Analysis 

Our goal is to propose solutions at any level of development: from planning your big-picture technological vision, to measuring and optimizing performance, to implementing state-of-the art prototype and production software.

## In-person (virtual) meetings

The best way to understand your needs and challenges you are facing is through personal meetings.
In our meetings we can go in depth on the specific problems you are facing, and we can keep in sync as your project advances. 


## Personalized workshops

If there is a specific technology or theory that you and your team wishes to better understand, we can help you with custom workshops. 
We have extensive experience in teaching at the university level and have presented technical workshops to wide audiences.

## Hiring Assessments

To make sure your team grows to include the most effective members possible, we can help you prepare interview questions and candidate screening for technical prowess.

## Custom Implementations & Troubleshooting 

As trained scientists, we have built many scientific tools from the ground-up.
